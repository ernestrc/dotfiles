# Atom Unicorn UI Theme

A retro theme for [Atom](https://atom.io) that matches the [unicorn syntax](https://atom.io/packages/unicorn-syntax). It has been rebuilt from [Jesse Weed's Seti UI Theme](https://github.com/jesseweed/seti-ui) to support icons for various file types. 

This theme can then be activated by going to the _Themes_ section in the Settings view (`cmd-,`) and selecting it from the _UI Themes_ drop-down menu.
