Or maybe not start at all. The bootstrapping of the Ensime server might be an issue. Please let me know if you have any troubles with the few features implemented. I guess most problems will probably be related to bootstrapping of the Ensime server.\n\n## Prerequisites\n- sbt (used to bootstrap server)\n- [.ensime file. generate with sbt gen-ensime](https://github.com/ensime/ensime-emacs/wiki/Quick-Start-Guide#installing-the-ensime-sbt-plugin)\n- Autocomplete-plus for autocomplete. https://atom.io/packages/autocomplete-plus\n\n## Getting started\n- Open a project with a .ensime in root\n- Make sure to put path of sbt in settings.\n- cmd-shift-P Ensime: Start.\n- Then you can use the features marked x below :)\n\n## Complementing packages:\n- [Project manager](https://github.com/danielbrodin/atom-project-manager) is really handy to keep track of projects.\n- Need plugin to navigate back to last cursor position when \"code surfing\". Maybe https://atom.io/packages/last-cursor-position\n- [Autocomplete-plus](https://atom.io/packages/autocomplete-plus) (needed for autocomplete feature of this package)\n\n## Features:\n- [x] Jump to definition (alt-click or f4)\n- [x] Hover for type info\n- [x] Errors and warnings (Cmnds for typecheck file, typecheck buffer, typecheck all). Also setting for typecheck current file on save or while typing.\n- [x] Basic autocompletion\n- [ ] Import type at point\n- [ ] Goto definition by simple typing prefix (like cmd-N in Idea or cmd-shift-T in Eclipse?)\n- [ ] Better errors and warnings with markings in gutter\n- [ ] View applied implicits\n- [ ] _insert your suggestion_\n\n\n## Dev\n- checkout from git straight into .atom/packages (or ln -s). Need to have the right name on the folder: \"Ensime\".\n- run apm install\n- \"Window: reload\" (ctrl-option-cmd l) to reload plugin from source while developing\n\n\n## Google group thread:\nhttps://groups.google.com/forum/#!searchin/ensime/log/ensime/1dWUQwnFoyk/0O12KPjaIBgJ\n\n\n## Technical TODO:\n- [x] checkout typescript plugin for hover for type info\n- [x] option to start server detached for ease of debugging: https://nodejs.org/api/child_process.html#child_process_options_detached\n- [x] update server log in a panel in atom\n- [x] Use port file to check for running server\n- [x] Remove \"start-server\" and let init do it all\n- [x] EditorControl leaks and keeps swank client on stop. Fix some cleanup!\n- [x] Remove flowController-thing and look at Haskell IDE.\n- [x] Make \"start ensime\" to start server(maybe) and client and \"stop ensime\" kill both\n- [x] setting for typechecking current file: ask, on save, while typing + delay ms setting\n- [x] only try start server if no port-file\n- [x] put console logging under dev-flag or just move to separate log\n- [x] Handle types of autocompletion. Weird swank?\n- [x] TEEEESTS! Mostly because turnaround is killing me\n- [x] re-insert activation events when this hits https://github.com/atom/settings-view/pull/371\n- [x] Make update of server implicit from startup'\n- [x] Seems we're dependent on language-scala package. At least code-links doesn't seem to realize .scala are source.scala)\n- [ ] If error with \"not found\" -> alt-enter for quick import just like idea\n- [ ] Look how https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-atom/wiki makes autocomplete and linter install automatically\n- [ ] Check out https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-atom Seems we can learn a lot!\n- [ ] Create FRP stream for editors that features can use.\n- [ ] Rewrite core parts in scala.js, reuse msg classes from ensime and so forth. Make atom interface for scala.js.\n- [ ] ditch swank for jerk\n- [ ] Wait for analyzer ready msg - (:return (:abort 209 \"Analyzer is not ready! Please wait.\") 4)\n- [ ] Setting for autocomplete - \"excludeLowerPriority\"\n- [ ] Autocomplete: :type-sig ((((\"x\" \"Int\") (\"y\" \"Int\"))) \"Int\")\n- [ ] Separate each feature in own Editor Controller?\n- [ ] server will stop logging when atom is reloaded since stdio is piped via node. Pipe to file directly from process\n and tail -f to buffer in atom?\n- [ ] getPath is deprecated: https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/src/project.coffee#L471 Maybe need to ask about where .ensime is like Emacs.\n- [ ] add a bottom panel with tabs (one for errors/warnings, one for server log maybe)\n- [ ] Isolate swank/lisp - it leaks everywhere\n- [ ] See if we can use code-links for mouse clicks https://atom.io/packages/code-links\n- [ ] Check if we can get rid of terminal escape stuff from log. Look at term2 or ask.\n\n## Inspiration (steal if you can)\n- https://github.com/lukehoban/atom-ide-flow/\n- code-links\n- https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/src/text-editor-component.coffee#L365\n- https://github.com/TypeStrong/atom-typescript/\n- https://github.com/chaika2013/ide-haskell/\n\n## Links\n- https://github.com/ensime/\n- Protocol: https://github.com/ensime/ensime-server/blob/master/swank/src/main/scala/org/ensime/server/protocol/swank/SwankProtocol.scala\n- Emacs command ref: https://github.com/ensime/ensime-server/wiki/Emacs-Command-Reference\n- Ensime google group: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ensime\n- Startup of server from Emacs https://github.com/ensime/ensime-emacs/blob/master/ensime-startup.el\n- Space pen https://github.com/atom/space-pen/blob/master/src/space-pen.coffee\n- Space pen views https://github.com/atom/atom-space-pen-views/blob/master/src/scroll-view.coffee\n- Find and replace:https://github.com/atom/find-and-replace/blob/master/lib/project/results-pane.coffee\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/ensime/ensime-atom/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/ensime/ensime-atom","_id":"Ensime@0.23.0","_shasum":"7dd0a4b0a2c08198d1bf275d3a72b277b09c41cb","_resolved":"file:../d-115727-31871-au019/package.tgz","_from":"../d-115727-31871-au019/package.tgz"}
